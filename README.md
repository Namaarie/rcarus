# rcarus

rcarus is the a version of [sotrh's learn-wgpu guide](https://github.com/sotrh/learn-wgpu) with minor changes for a better user experience. This is intended mostly as template/starting point for future projects. Updates will get merged into here as I update and refactor the codebase. rcarus is named after Rust and Icarus as my projects using rcarus will mostly likely crash and burn for flying too close to the sun.
